# Agentic Agent Design for LangGraph App

## AI Agents
### Orchestrator
- **Role**: Manages the workflow and coordination between different AI agents.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Initiate and manage the interaction between agents.
  - Handle tool calls and responses.
  - Ensure the flow of information between agents is smooth and efficient.


### Planner
- **Role**: Plans the sequence of actions and interactions needed to achieve a specific goal.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Analyze the task and break it down into manageable steps.
  - Determine which agents and tools are needed for each step.
  - Create a plan that outlines the order of operations.

### Executor
- **Role**: Executes the plan created by the Planner.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Carry out the actions as per the plan.
  - Call the necessary tools (like RAG) to retrieve information or perform tasks.
  - Provide feedback to the Orchestrator on the execution status.

### Evaluator
- **Role**: Evaluates the outcomes of the actions taken by the Executor.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Assess the results of the Executor's actions.
  - Determine if the goal has been achieved or if further actions are needed.
  - Provide feedback to the Orchestrator and Planner for adjustments.

## Tools
### RAG Tool
- **Role**: Supports retrieval augmented generation by fetching relevant information based on queries.
- **Functionality**:
  - Can be called via HTTP requests.
  - Returns relevant data that can be used by other agents in the workflow.
  - Can be configured to handle different types of queries and data retrieval tasks.

### MCP Tool
- **Role**: Manages the protocal for Agent can using tools.
- **Functionality**:
  - Provides a standardized way for agents to interact with tools.
  - Ensures that tool calls are made in a consistent manner.
  - Handles the responses from tools and passes them back to the appropriate agents.

## Memory and State Management with LangGraph

### LangGraph State Management
LangGraph provides a robust state management system that serves as the foundation for all memory in the application. The StateGraph object maintains a shared state that is accessible to all agents in the workflow:

```python
# Example of LangGraph state definition
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: list[dict]  # Conversation history
    task: dict            # Current task details
    plan: list[dict]      # Plan created by Planner
    execution: dict       # Execution status and history
    evaluation: dict      # Evaluation results
    tool_calls: list[dict]  # History of tool calls and responses
    context: dict         # Additional context information
```

### Memory Components
The state maintained by LangGraph includes:
- **Current task or goal**: The main objective being worked on
- **Plan details**: Steps created by the Planner agent
- **Execution status**: Current progress and results from the Executor
- **Evaluation results**: Feedback and assessments from the Evaluator
- **Tool call history**: Records of interactions with RAG, MCP, and other tools
- **Agent interactions**: The sequence and results of agent activations
- **Conversation history**: Complete record of user-agent interactions

### LangGraph Memory Integration
- **Graph-Based Memory Flow**: LangGraph's directed graph structure ensures that memory flows correctly between agents according to the defined workflow
- **State Transitions**: Each agent receives the current state, updates it, and passes the updated state to the next agent
- **Checkpointing**: LangGraph supports state serialization for persistence between sessions
- **Memory Context Windows**: Built-in support for managing context windows when dealing with large conversation histories

### Conversational Memory
The conversational aspects of memory include:
- **Full conversation history** with timestamps
- **User inputs and agent responses**
- **Referenced context** and retrieved information
- **Session metadata** (session ID, start time, etc.)
- **Key information** extracted from the conversation

### Custom Memory Extensions
While leveraging LangGraph's built-in capabilities, the system implements custom memory features:
- **Persistence Layer**: Saving and loading state to/from disk
- **Memory Indexing**: For fast retrieval of relevant context
- **Memory Compression**: Techniques for summarizing older context when memory grows large
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Maintaining relevant information across different user sessions

## Workflow with LangGraph

### LangGraph-Managed Flow
The workflow is implemented as a LangGraph directed graph, with nodes representing agents and edges defining the flow of control and information:

```
Orchestrator → Planner → Executor → Evaluator → (loop back or end)
```

### Workflow Steps
1. **Initiation**: 
   - The UI Controller passes user input to the LangGraph workflow
   - LangGraph activates the Orchestrator node with initial state
   - Orchestrator processes the input and prepares the task

2. **Planning**: 
   - LangGraph routes state to the Planner node
   - Planner analyzes the task and creates a detailed plan
   - State is updated with the plan and passed to the next node

3. **Execution**: 
   - LangGraph activates the Executor node with the updated state
   - Executor follows the plan, calling tools via the MCP
   - Execution results are added to the state

4. **Evaluation**: 
   - LangGraph routes to the Evaluator node
   - Evaluator assesses the results and determines next steps
   - Based on evaluation, LangGraph uses conditional routing:
     - If complete: workflow ends
     - If needs refinement: loops back to Planner
     - If needs more execution: returns to Executor

5. **Conditional Branching**:
   - LangGraph evaluates conditions to determine the next node
   - Custom routing functions determine the path based on state
   - Supports dynamic, adaptive workflows based on intermediate results

### LangGraph Configuration Example
```python
# Define conditional routing
def route_after_evaluation(state: AgentState) -> str:
    if state["evaluation"]["status"] == "complete":
        return "complete"
    elif state["evaluation"]["status"] == "refine_plan":
        return "planner"
    else:
        return "executor"

# Configure the workflow graph
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "evaluator",
    route_after_evaluation,
    {
        "complete": END,
        "planner": "planner",
        "executor": "executor"
    }
)

# Compile the graph into an executable
agent_app = workflow.compile()
```

## Technical Design

### 1. System Architecture

The system is composed of modular AI agents (Orchestrator, Planner, Executor, Evaluator), tool interfaces (RAG, MCP), a memory/state management layer, and a UI layer separated from the core functionality. All components interact via well-defined APIs and message-passing. This separation allows for switching between different UI implementations (CLI, GUI, etc.) without modifying the core system.

### 7. UI Abstraction Principles

To ensure proper separation between UI implementations and the core system, the following principles are established:

#### Command Pattern
- All user actions are translated into commands with a consistent structure
- Commands are serializable and can be passed between UI and core system
- UI-specific details are stripped before reaching the core system

#### Response Formatting
- Core system returns raw data and metadata
- UI Controller applies formatting appropriate to the specific UI
- Format converters handle transformations between different UI requirements

#### Configuration Isolation
- Core configuration and UI configuration are separated
- UI-specific settings don't affect core behavior
- Shared configurations are managed through an abstraction layer

#### Interface Definition
- Clear API contracts between UI and core system
- Stable interfaces that won't change when adding new UI implementations
- Versioned interfaces to allow for evolution while maintaining backward compatibility

#### Event-Driven Communication
- UI updates driven by events from the core system
- Asynchronous processing to keep UI responsive
- Event subscriptions based on UI capabilities

#### Testing Strategy
- UI components testable in isolation from core system
- Mock core system for UI testing
- Mock UI for core system testing
- Integration tests that verify correct interaction
